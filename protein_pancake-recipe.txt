Protein pancakes
“These oaty pancakes are packed with fibre and protein and are low in refined sugars. Top with your favourite fruits and nut butter. ”

Ingredients:
100 g oats
2 large free-range eggs
100 g cottage cheese
1 banana
1 pinch of baking powder
1 splash of almond milk
groundnut oil
TOPPINGS
4 tablespoons almond butter
2 teaspoons runny honey
4 tablespoons fat-free Greek yoghurt
4 fresh figs
1 pear
1 apple
1 handful of pomegranate seeds

Method
Blitz all the pancake ingredients (except the oil) in a blender until smooth, adding an extra splash of almond milk if it’s too thick.
Prepare all your toppings in small bowls, slicing the figs. Core and coarsely grate the pear and apple, then toss with the pomegranate. Set aside.
Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, brush with oil, then pour out any excess.
Drop heaped tablespoons of the batter into the pan and cook for 3 minutes, or until little bubbles start to form on the surface.
Carefully flip with a palette knife and cook for a few more minutes, or until the pancakes are lightly golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate.
Layer the pancakes up with the fruit and almond butter, drizzle over the honey and spoon on the yoghurt.
